### MongoDB

- **Version**: 4.5.0
- **Description**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing and managing data. It's often used in modern web applications for its document-based structure.

## Key Features

### REST API CRUD Operations

This project incorporates RESTful API endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various resources, enhancing the interactivity and data management of the application.

### Product Management

- **Add Product**: The application allows authorized users to add new products to the system, providing details such as product name, description, and price.

- **Read Product**: Users can view a list of available products, along with their details, creating a seamless shopping experience.

- **Update Product**: The application provides functionality to update product information, ensuring accurate and up-to-date product data.

- **Delete Product**: Authorized users can remove products from the system, maintaining an organized product catalog.

### Protected Routes

To ensure data security and user privacy, the project features protected routes that require user authentication before accessing specific pages or functionalities. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the application.

### User Authentication

The authentication system enables users to sign up and log in to the application securely. This feature provides a personalized experience and allows users to access their personalized dashboards.

### User and Admin Dashboards

The application features separate dashboards for users and administrators, each tailored to their specific roles and permissions.

- **User Dashboard**: Users can view their profile information, order history, and other personalized data.

- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrators have access to advanced functionalities, including managing products, users, and orders.

### Login and Signup

- **Login**: Registered users can log in to their accounts securely, providing access to personalized content and features.

- **Signup**: New users can create accounts by signing up, allowing them to become part of the application's community.
